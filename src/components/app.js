The view layer binding introduces three concepts:
The Provider component: This is wrapped around the component tree. It makes it easy for the root componentâ€™s children to
                        hook up to the store using connect().

connect(): This is a function provided by react-redux. If a component wants to get state updates, it wraps itself using connect().
                  Then the connect function will set up all the wiring for it, using the selector.

selector: This is a function that you write. It specifies what parts of the state a component needs as properties.
